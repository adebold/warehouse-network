          Since authentication cannot be automated due to org policies, 
          please run these commands locally or in Cloud Shell:
          
          ```bash
          cd apps/web
          gcloud run deploy warehouse-frontend \
            --source . \
            --region us-central1 \
            --allow-unauthenticated \
            --project easyreno-demo-20251219144606
          ```
          
          This will:
          1. Build the container in Cloud Build (linux/amd64)
          2. Deploy to Cloud Run
          3. Return the service URL
